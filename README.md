# My-Goals-and-Ambitions-
A description of my goals and ambitions in the world of CS and Engineering 

Hello, My name is Jun, and I am apart of Mr.Sze's grade 11 computer science class in George Vanier High School.
I personally don't see computer science and engineering as a important part of my future planned career as I initially took this course in grade 9 as a filler, but I ended up finding computer science to be an enjoyable topic which I continued taking up till grade 11 and possibly in grade 12.
